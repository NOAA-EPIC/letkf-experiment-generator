This set of scripts leverages the universal workflow tools (https://github.com/ufs-community/uwtools.git) to set up an experiment for the fv3jedi_letkf.x application built using the ufs-bundle from JCSDA (https://github.com/JCSDA/ufs-bundle.git). This repo does not include the actual binary files required for a setup, but will correctly provision all the input files required by the app if data directories (c96_INPUT, c96_data, Data, and restart files in memXXX directories).
